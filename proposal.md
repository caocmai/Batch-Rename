# Proposal
Create a Go program that changes the name of files in batches. 

## Objective
The object of this project is to have the ability to rename generically named files to something that makes more sense. For example, when we take pictures on a camera all the images are typically named as 0001 for the first image and then 0002 for the second image and so on. I want to rename those images to be something more meaningful, i.e. "Hawaii_2020_001", "Hawaii_2020_002".
